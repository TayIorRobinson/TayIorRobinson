Hey! I'm Taylor. I write code (on occasion) and publish it here (sometimes). Most of my code is published to my other GitHub account.

I'm proficient in JavaScript and front-end web development, and somewhat knowledgable in C#. I also sometimes work in Lua & Python.

If you need to contact me, don't be afraid to drop me a line.
